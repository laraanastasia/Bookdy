Putnam's Sons Books for Young Readers,Hardcover,292,2021,2021,2025/03/05,2025/03/05,,,read,"I thoroughly enjoyed the dark and eerie setting in this book. I can't lie, I did already predict the majority of the plot points - nothing really groundbreaking happened if you read a thing or two on folklore/the supernatural - but that did not take away my fun while I basically devoured this book. This was purely a vibe-read for me, and vibes it delivered. <br/><br/>I do find it rather disappointing that Grey was not the main character. For me, she would have been the perfect protaganist for a book like this. I get that the author wanted a dark mystery, but why couldn't we follow Grey while she found out about the Halfway? Learn everything she just info dumps on the actual mc with her? <br/>Young Adult books tend to shy away from making the mc morally grey, but this book would have hugely benefitted from that. Instead we follow Iris, who for me kinda just felt like a grey wall. She wants to forget that anything happened to her and her sisters, which in real life would be absolutely understandable, but makes for a poor read in a book. I personally would much rather follow a character like Grey, that obsesses with what happened and actually uses their power for an advantage, instead of shying away from it. <br/><br/>I still enjoyed this book, the vibes were impeccable, the writing was beautiful and it was short enough so that none of my criticism actually became bothersome enough for me to stop reading.
